          <p>
            Recently <a href="https://twitter.com/swannodette">David Nolan</a>
            has
            <a
            href="http://swannodette.github.io/2013/07/31/extracting-processes/">written
            about</a> how a combination of <strong>event stream
            processing</strong> and <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes">
            Communicating Sequencial processes</a> can be used to <a
            href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">
            simplify</a> UI programming.

            He proposes a novel three part architecture consisting of:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Event stream processing</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Event stream coordination</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Interface representation</strong></li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            I'm quite taken with <strong>stream processing</strong>, so much so
            that I'm writing <a
            href="https://github.com/logaan/promise-stream">a ClojureScript
            library</a> that enables it. <strong>Interface
            representation</strong> is a brilliant idea and I wish I'd thought
            of it before. However <strong>stream coordination</strong> was new
            to me and it is the main focus of this response.
          </p>

          <h2>Stream Coordination Examples</h2>

          <p>
            Nolan gives no strict definition for <strong>stream
            coordination</strong>, instead he illustrates with examples.
            It is possible that I've missunderstood the concept and that I'm
            mistaking shortcomings of toy examples for shortcomings of the
            concept.
            However I feel the examples are more complex, and less functional,
            than raw <strong>stream processing</strong>. So I'm left feeling
            that <strong>stream coordination</strong> should be avoided.
          </p>

          <p>
            The coordination functions <code>selector</code> and
            <code>highlighter</code> take and return <a
            href="https://github.com/clojure/core.async">core.async</a>
            channels. This is great as it means these processes don't
            care where the events come from or end up. Composing them extends
            the functionality of the UI. But I feel there are some drawbacks to
            this approach:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Neither function is pure. They pull values out of the channel.
              This both mutates the chanel (removing the value) and means we
              can not determine the return values purely from function
              arguments.
            </li>
            <li>
              Recognition of events and processing are handled in the same
              function. A simpler design would split these responsabilities.
            </li>
            <li>
              Explicit flow control (<code>loop</code>/<code>recur</code>) and
              event emition (<code>&gt;!</code>) are required. If <a
              href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_order_functions">higher-order
              functions</a> were used both of these things could be eliminated.
            </li>
            <li>
              By only passing along unknown events the functions must assume
              all responsability for those events which they process. This is
              less flexible than allowing for multiple consumers of each
              channel.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Raw stream processing</h2>

          <p>
            I've implemented the highlight / selection example using raw
            <strong>stream processing</strong>. <em>Click in the box to give it
            focus then use up, down, j, k and enter to change highlight and
            make selections.</em>
          </p>

          <div class="example">
            <pre id="ex1" tabindex="1"></pre>
          </div>

          <p>
            You can see the full code <a
              href="https://github.com/logaan/extracting-processes/blob/master/src/extracting_processes/core.cljs">on
              github</a> but I've included the meat of it here. It's written
            using <a
              href="https://github.com/logaan/promise-stream">promise-streams</a>
            which aim to provide event streams in an idiomatic Clojure way.
            They're implemented as promises wrapped around <a
              href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cons">cons cells</a>, and
            provide asynchronous version of the sequence functions you'd
            expect.
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>
              I've created <a href="data-flow.svg">a graph</a> of the data flow
              through the system. It may give you, at a glance, a feel for how
              everything ties together.
            </em>
          </p>

          <p>
            I feel that this <strong>stream processing</strong> code addresses
            my concerns with the <strong>stream coordination</strong> code.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <code>load-example</code> grabs events from the document, feeds
              them through the purely functional code, and finally dumps the
              rendered ui into the dom. This is what I've come to expect from
              good clojure code, a thin crispy shell around a delicious
              functional core.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>identify-events</code> recognises events.
              <code>track-highlight</code>, <code>track-ui-states</code> and
              <code>selection</code> give the events meaning, manage state and
              handle rendering.
            </li>
            <li>
              The functions are just passing the data through a sequence of
              super simple processing steps. The functions passed into the HOFs
              need not care that they're dealing with steams of events.
            </li>
            <li>
              Streams can be re-used without their needing to explicitly allow
              it. On line 22 you can see <code>selection</code> passing the
              <code>actions</code> stream to both <code>track-highlight</code>
              and <code>track-ui-states</code>.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            My code only takes the first two steps from Nolan's post. It's
            possible that there are complications introduced from the mouse
            interactions that haven't occured to me. But I've previously
            written <a
              href="https://github.com/logaan/promise-stream/blob/master/test/promise_stream/quick_search_example.cljs">the
              other half of an autocompleter</a> and I think I see how a full
            <strong>stream processing</strong> solution would come together.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm looking forward to seeing the concluding post in his
            <strong>CSP</strong> autocompleter series. I hope that he clarifies
            exactly what he has in mind by <strong>stream
              coordination</strong>. If anyone disagrees with my observations,
            or has a better understanding of what's going on than I do, please
            <a href="mailto:colin@logaan.net">email</a> or <a
              href="https://twitter.com/logaan">tweet at</a> me.
