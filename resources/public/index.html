          <p>
            Recently <a href="https://twitter.com/swannodette">David Nolan</a>
            has
            <a
            href="http://swannodette.github.io/2013/07/31/extracting-processes/">written
            about</a> how a combination of <strong>event stream
            processing</strong> and <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes">
            communicating sequencial processes</a> can be used to <a
            href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">
            simplify</a> user interface programming.

            He proposes a novel three part architecture consisting of:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>Event stream processing</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Event stream coordination</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Interface representation</strong></li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            I'm quite taken with <strong>stream processing</strong>, so much so
            that I'm writing <a
            href="https://github.com/logaan/promise-stream">a ClojureScript
            library</a> that enables it. <strong>Interface
            representation</strong> is a brilliant idea and I wish I'd thought
            of it before. However <strong>stream coordination</strong> was new
            to me and it is the main focus of this response.
          </p>

          <h2>Stream Coordination Examples</h2>

          <p>
            Nolan gives no strict definition for <strong>stream
            coordination</strong>, instead he illustrates with examples. To me
            the examples look more complex, and less functional, than raw
            <strong>stream processing</strong>. So I'm left feeling that
            <strong>stream coordination</strong> should be avoided.
          </p>

          <p>
            The coordination functions <code>selector</code> and
            <code>highlighter</code> take and return <a
            href="https://github.com/clojure/core.async">core.async</a>
            channels. This is great as it means these processes don't care
            where the events come from or end up. Composing them extends the
            functionality of the user interface. But there are some drawbacks
            to this approach:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Neither function is pure. They read values out of the channel.
              This both mutates the chanel (removing the value) and means we
              can not determine the return values purely from the function
              arguments.
            </li>
            <li>
              Recognition, and processing of events are handled in the same
              function. A simpler design would split these responsabilities.
            </li>
            <li>
              Explicit flow control (<code>loop</code>/<code>recur</code>) and
              event emition (<code>&gt;!</code>) are required. <a
              href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_order_functions">Higher-order
              functions</a> could eliminate both of these chores.
            </li>
            <li>
              The functions emit only unknown events. This means they must
              assume all responsability for those events which they process.
              This is less flexible than allowing for multiple consumers of
              each channel.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Raw stream processing</h2>

          <p>
            I've implemented the highlight / selection example using raw
            <strong>stream processing</strong>. <em>Click in the box to give it
            focus then use up, down, j, k and enter to change highlight and
            make selections.</em>
          </p>

          <div class="example">
            <pre id="ex1" tabindex="1"></pre>
          </div>

          <p>
            You can see the full code <a
            href="https://github.com/logaan/extracting-processes/blob/master/src/extracting_processes/core.cljs">on
            github</a> but I've included the meat of it here. It's written
            using <a
            href="https://github.com/logaan/promise-stream">promise-streams</a>
            which aim to provide event streams in an idiomatic Clojure way.
            They're implemented as <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises">promises</a>
            wrapped around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cons">cons
            cells</a>, and provide asynchronous versions of Clojure's sequence
            functions.
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>
              I've created <a href="data-flow.svg">a graph</a> of the data flow
              through the system. It labels the kinds of events at each step
              and may help you get a feel for how everything ties together.
            </em>
          </p>

          <p>
            This <strong>stream processing</strong> code addresses my concerns
            with the <strong>stream coordination</strong> code.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <code>load-example</code> grabs events from the document, feeds
              them through the purely functional code, and finally dumps the
              rendered ui into the dom. This is what I've come to expect from
              Clojure code; a thin procedural shell around a delicious
              functional core.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>identify-events</code> recognises events.
              <code>track-highlight</code>, <code>track-ui-states</code> and
              <code>selection</code> give the events meaning, manage state and
              handle rendering.
            </li>
            <li>
              The functions are just passing the data through a sequence of
              super simple processing steps. The functions passed into the
              higher-order functions need not care that they're dealing with
              steams of events.
            </li>
            <li>
              Streams can be re-used without their needing to explicitly allow
              it. <code>selection</code> passes the <code>actions</code> stream
              to both <code>track-highlight</code> and
              <code>track-ui-states</code>.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            My code only takes the first two steps from Nolan's post. It's
            possible that there are complications introduced from the mouse
            interactions that haven't occured to me. But I've previously
            written <a
              href="https://github.com/logaan/promise-stream/blob/master/test/promise_stream/quick_search_example.cljs">the
              other half of an autocompleter</a> and I think I see how a full
            <strong>stream processing</strong> solution would come together.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm looking forward to seeing the concluding post in his
            <strong>CSP</strong> autocompleter series. I hope that he clarifies
            exactly what he has in mind by <strong>stream
              coordination</strong>. If anyone disagrees with my observations,
            or has a better understanding of what's going on than I do, please
            <a href="mailto:colin@logaan.net">email</a> or <a
              href="https://twitter.com/logaan">tweet at</a> me.
