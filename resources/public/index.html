          <p>
            Recently <a href="https://twitter.com/swannodette">David Nolan</a>
            proposed a novel three part design pattern in a post titled <a
            href="http://swannodette.github.io/2013/07/31/extracting-processes/">
            CSP is Responsive Design</a>. He demonstrates how a combination of
            Event Stream Processing and <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes">
            CSP</a> can be used to <a
            href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">
            simplify</a> UI programming. The three parts he proposes are:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>Event stream processing</li>
            <li>Event stream coordination</li>
            <li>Interface representation</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            This caught my attention as recently I've been thinking hard about
            using event stream processing for UIs. However the concept of event
            stream coordination was new to me. No strict definition is given,
            rather he illustrates by way of examples.
          </p>

          <p>
            The coordination functions <code>selector</code> and
            <code>highlighter</code> take and return <a
            href="https://github.com/clojure/core.async">core.async</a>
            channels.
          </p>

          <div class="example">
            <pre id="ex0" tabindex="1"></pre>
          </div>
